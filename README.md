# Diabetes early stage detection
Diabetes is a horrible chronic disease that leads to a relatively lower quality of life,
and can be life threatening if not diagnosed early. 
In this beginner project, 
we work with clinical data and train a model to predict diabetes status in a patient.

### Early Diabetes Detection I
In this first part of a 3-part series, 
we will acquire and clean clinical data from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

### Early Diabetes Detection II
In the second part, we perform statistical analysis and visualize the data using data visualization methods.

### Early Diabetes Detection III
In this final part, we train a machine learning model using the data we collected and clean. We then assess the model by examining the feature importances.
